          Welcome to <strong>BrightSpark Hire Consultancy Solutions</strong>. By
          enrolling in our training programs or using our recruitment platform,
          you agree to the following Terms & Conditions. Please read them
          carefully before proceeding.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Services</h3>

          availability and candidate eligibility.
        </p>

        <h3>2. User Accounts</h3>

          are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login
          credentials and all activities under your account.
        </p>

            program.
          </li>
          <li>

            course and assessments.
          </li>
