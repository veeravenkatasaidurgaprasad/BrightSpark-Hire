        <h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to <strong>BrightSpark Hire Consultancy Solutions</strong>. By
          enrolling in our training programs or using our recruitment platform,
          you agree to the following Terms & Conditions. Please read them
          carefully before proceeding.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Services</h3>
        <p>
          We provide hospitality-focused recruitment and training services,
          including
          <strong>Opera PMS & Cloud Training</strong>,
          <strong>Certification Programs</strong>, and a
          <strong>Job Guarantee Program</strong>. Services are subject to
          availability and candidate eligibility.
        </p>

        <h3>2. User Accounts</h3>
        <p>
          Candidates must provide accurate information during registration. You
          are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login
          credentials and all activities under your account.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Training Programs</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            All training fees must be paid in full before the start of the
            program.
          </li>
          <li>
            Certificates are issued only upon successful completion of the
            course and assessments.
          </li>
          <li>
            Job Guarantee applies exclusively to candidates who complete
            training and certification requirements.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ongoing career support (mentorship, interview prep, and CV building)
            is provided as part of the program.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Job Guarantee</h3>
        <p>
          Our <strong>90-day Job Guarantee</strong> ensures that successful
          graduates are placed with a hospitality employer within 90 days of
          certification. If placement is not secured within this period and
          eligibility criteria are met, a refund will be processed as per our
          placement policy.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Refund Policy</h3>
        <p>
          Refunds are available only under the Job Guarantee clause, subject to
          the candidate fulfilling all training obligations (attendance,
          assignments, and assessments). No refunds are provided for voluntary
          withdrawals.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Candidate Conduct</h3>
        <p>
          Candidates must maintain professional behavior during training and
          recruitment. Misuse of the platform, providing false information, or
          engaging in unethical practices may result in termination without
          refund.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Limitation of Liability</h3>
        <p>
          While we ensure quality training and verified employer connections, we
          are not responsible for third-party employer actions, visa issues, or
          external factors affecting job placements.
